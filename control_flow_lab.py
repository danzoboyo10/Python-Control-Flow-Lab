# Write the code that:
# 1. Calculates and prints the first 50 terms of the fibonacci sequence.

print('hello')

# 2. Print each term and number as follows:
#      term: 0 / number: 0
#      term: 1 / number: 1
#      term: 2 / number: 1
#      term: 3 / number: 2
#      term: 4 / number: 3
#      term: 5 / number: 5
#      etc.

# Hint: The next number is found by adding the two numbers before it

# exercise-06 What's the  Season?

# Write the code that:
# 3. Prompts the user to enter the month (as three characters):
#      Enter the month of the season (Jan - Dec):




# 4. Then propts the user to enter the day of the month: 
#      Enter the day of the month:






# 5. Calculate what season it is based upon this chart:
#      Dec 21 - Mar 19: Winter
#      Mar 20 - Jun 20: Spring
#      Jun 21 - Sep 21: Summer
#      Sep 22 - Dec 20: Fall




# 6. Print the result as follows:
#      <Mmm> <dd> is in <season> 

# Hints:
# Consider using the in operator to check if a string is in a particular list/tuple like this:
# if input_month in ('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar'):




# After setting the likely season, you can use another if...elif...else statement to "adjust" if
# the day number falls within a certain range.
